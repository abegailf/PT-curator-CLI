Here are the available commands:

/start: Begins the curation session. I will prompt you to provide the worksheet OCR, the existing PT set, and the topic context.

/run gap_analysis: Analyzes the provided worksheet against the existing PTs to find gaps. This command initializes the Master Alignment Log and reports on which skills are missing.

/evaluate: Initiates the review of new candidate PTs. I will ask you to provide the candidate PT XMLs, then I will generate a recommendation report for you to decide which PTs to add to the curated set.

/organize_and_report: Finalizes the process. I will organize all curated PTs, assign difficulties, and generate a final, pedagogically-sorted report and a comma-separated list of all selected PT IDs.

/help: Displays this list of available commands and their functions.
